odep - Generate dependency dot graph from object files and static library files.

This is useful when compiling a large or small projects to visualize the 
dependencies at the object level.

This is a utility that, given a list of static library files and/or object
files will generate a dot file that can be used to graph the dependencies 
between libraries and object files. It parses all fo the symbols in the files
and finds their dependencies.  You can even list external dependencies.

Dependencies
------------
There are no compilation dependencies.


Bulding
-------
./autogen.sh
./configure
./make


Usage
-----

usage: ./odep -o OUTPUT [OPTIONS] PATH ...

-o OUTPUT     Output dot file
PATH          Path to a directory or file
-r, -R        Recursive search
-a            Parse library files (.a)
-j            Parse object files (.o) (default)
-u            Graph dependencies on undefined symbols
-h, -help     Show this menu


Running
-------
cd src
./odep -a -o odep.out .

There is also an odepwrapper script in src/ that shows how to run it.


Viewing the Graph
-----------------
WARNING: There is a known issue displaying lablels in dotty from graphviz. It's been broken
for awhile now and the developers claim they can't reproduce it. It looks to be a font issue.

To use the dot file you'll need the graphiz package installed from: http://www.graphviz.org/
zgrviewer also provides a nice viewer, but it still needs graphviz tools.
